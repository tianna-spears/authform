This is a project from the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path (Unit 4/5).

The purpose of building this application is to sharpen skills in React components by creating a React component to set up a simple authorization layer.

Thank you for your support! 

Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
